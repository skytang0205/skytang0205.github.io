I'm currently a fourth-year undergraduate student from School of EECS, Peking University, advised by Prof. [Baoquan Chen](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/baoquan/).  As a member of the [Visual Computing and Learning Lab](https://vcl.pku.edu.cn/), I was also advised and Prof. [Mengyu Chu](https://rachelcmy.github.io/).
